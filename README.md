My Ruby2D Program

Overview
This program simulates the flipping of a coin using the Ruby2D library. It defines a Coin class, which has two sides (heads and tails) and can be flipped by clicking the mouse. The program displays the current side of the coin on the screen using the Ruby2D Text class.

Technologies Used
This program was written in Ruby and uses the Ruby2D library to create graphical user interfaces.

Challenges Faced
One challenge faced during the development of this program was understanding how to create and manipulate graphical objects in Ruby2D. Another challenge was handling mouse clicks and updating the coin's side accordingly. These were overcome by referencing the Ruby2D documentation and experimenting with different approaches.

Future Improvements
Future improvements to this program could include adding sound effects or animations to the coin flip, implementing a betting system based on the outcome of the flip, or allowing the user to choose between different coin types.

How to Use
To use this program, simply run the "coin_flip.rb" file in a Ruby environment. The program will create a window displaying the coin and its current side. Clicking the mouse on the window will flip the coin and update its side.

Credits
